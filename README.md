## Leak Localization in Water Distribution Networks Using Artificial Neural Network
### Step 1ï¼šGeneratioon of leak dataset, see foder 1-Dataset
1. Run simu_tool.ipynb step by step.

2. To simiplify network, run topo_delete_pipe.py&topo_delete_node.py.

### Step 2: Training of ANN, see foder 2-NN
1. Modify model structure in ann.py.

2. Run nn_train.ipynb step by step.

3. Run nn_draw.py to plot ANN prediction results.

#### Note: The hydraulic simulation software is not available in demo.
